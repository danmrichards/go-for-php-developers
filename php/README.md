# Go for PHP Developers
This is a simple PHP REST API. It's intention is to be used in a benchmark against a Go application providing equivalent functionality.

## Usage
The quickest way to get started is to use the PHP built in web server:
```bash
$ php -S localhost:8080
```
While this isn't the fastest web server out there, it's far beyond the scope of this exercise to setup nginx or similar.
