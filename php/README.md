# Go for PHP Developers
This is a simple PHP REST API. It's intention is to be used in a benchmark against a Go application providing equivalent functionality.

## Usage
A basic web stack with PHP-FPM and nginx is provided by Docker. To start the stack:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```
You can then access the API on localhost:8080
